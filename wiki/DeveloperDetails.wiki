*protoc-gen-docbook* is written in C++, and is a process-based plugin used by the Protobuf Compiler (protoc).
The plugin architecture, which is well defined within protoc, allows it to load external process for additional language generation support.

Here is the developer oriented documentation in [https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/reference/cpp/google.protobuf.compiler.plugin.pb plugin.pb.h]
{{{
// A plugin executable needs only to be placed somewhere in the path.  The
// plugin should be named "protoc-gen-$NAME", and will then be used when the
// flag "--${NAME}_out" is passed to protoc.
}}}

Therefore, protoc-gen-docbook relies on entirely on protoc to parse the input .proto source file. The parse results are then encoded in protobuf and be passed into protoc-gen-docbook through _stdin_. This information is called the *descriptor*. protoc-gen-docbook handles the descriptor information, and generates DocBook output.

If protoc-gen-docbook is in the same path as protoc, it will be loaded automatically through the following command.

{{{
protoc --docbook_out=. --proto_path=$your_proto_path $your_proto_file
}}}
