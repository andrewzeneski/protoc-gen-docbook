== Before we start ==
Download the latest release from the [http://code.google.com/p/protoc-gen-docbook/downloads/list Download] page. You want the *Full Release* since it comes with everything you need.

== Step 3 - Wait...==

At this point, a command prompt should pop up with some messages and warnings (don't worry, they are harmless). This is Apache FOP performing its PDF transformation. Depending on your proto files, it may take a few seconds or more.

== Step 4 - Profit==
Now you should see two new files generated by the transformation. *docbook-out.xml* is the DocBook output, and *docbook-out.pdf* is the PDF output. That's it!
