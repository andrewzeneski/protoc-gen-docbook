This tutorial will try to get protoc-gen-docbook up and running on your machine with as few steps as possible.

== Before we start ==
Download the latest release from the [http://code.google.com/p/protoc-gen-docbook/downloads/list Download] page. You want the *Full Release* since it comes with everything you need.


== Step 1 - Unzip the release package==

Unzip the release, and you should see the following folder layout. ([http://www.7-zip.org 7zip] is free)

== Step 2 - Put your protos in deploy folder==

Open up the deploy folder and put all your proto source files in this folder. Then click on *Run.bat*.

== Step 3 - Wait...==

At this point, a command prompt should pop up with some messages and warnings (don't worry, they are harmless). This is Apache FOP performing the PDF transformation. Depending on your proto files, it may take a few seconds or more.

== Step 4 - Profit==
Now you should see two new files generated by the transformation. *docbook-out.xml* is the DocBook output, and *docbook-out.pdf* is the PDF output. That's it!
